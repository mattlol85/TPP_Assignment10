Database testing.

Assignment:
Download and install PostgreSQL on your devices (for Mac users I recommend the app)
Using Figma/Lucidchart, create an ER Diagram of your database
Create a brand new database with a specific topic (eg pizza, students, employees, etc.) with 
At least four different tables.
Each table should have a primary key
Each table should have at least four dummy tuples
Each table should be able to be joined with one other table in the database (this will make sense once you understand schemas)
Write an inner join query that joins two tables, one that joins three tables and one that joins all four tables (you can stack inner joins)
Finally using Postman, try to post a brand new line of data and get two different lines of dummy data that you placed inside the database. Take a screenshot of your work on Postman and put it inside of your repo.
You can do this by either setting up Express routes to hit (recommended) or straight through the database using xmysql package
**You donâ€™t have to try running your code on the psql shell, but it is recommended so you can make sure that you understand sql properly. 
***Highly recommend that you remember where you installed your postgres server on your windows pc, you need to add the postgres bin to your environmental variables to connect to postgres with libraries like node-postgres.
